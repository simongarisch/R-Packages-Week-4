As part of Coursera's Building R packages we are required to provide documentation to some 
functions, package the result and load it on github. The criteria are:

 1. Write a vignette to include in your package using knitr and R Markdown
 2. Write at least one test written using testthat
 3. Put your package on GitHub
 4. Set up the repository so that the package can be checked and built on Travis
Once your package has built on Travis and the build is passing with no errors, warnings, or notes you should add your Travis badge to the README.md file of your package repository.
